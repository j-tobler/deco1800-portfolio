                    <br>
                    My team unanimously decided that the most effective way to delegate responsibilities for this project was to allocate each team member their own section of the concept document to complete. Those specialisations would then be made of good use in the division of tasks for the presentation slides, as members could be responsible for slides related to their section in the concept document, and speak for their own slides in the pitch. A positive outcome of this strategy was the relatively low interdependencies between team members, resulting in minimal need to communicate and collaborate. However, this lack of communication also resulted in a slight lack of coordination between team members in future assignments, as some were unaware of aspects of our website which were established by individuals in the concept document, such as the site structure and some site elements such as ambiguous buttons.
                    <br>
                    &lt;/<span style="color: #e06c75;">p</span>&gt;

                    <br>
                    My role in this assignment was the ‘Task Allocations’ and ‘Potential Issues and Solutions’ sections of the concept document, and the ‘Site Structure’ section of the presentation slides. To determine task allocations, I divided the team’s tasks into three general categories: ‘design’, ‘frontend coding’ and ‘backend coding’, and had each team member list their preferences on a spreadsheet, as shown in figure-1. I then determined allocations based on these preferences, as well as the expected difficulty and size of the category. To promote collaboration, I also allocated most team members to two categories, and ensured one team member was responsible for each distinct pair of categories. This system worked fairly well, with most team members adhering to their general responsibilities for the duration of the semester, and no team members being responsible for tasks they did not want to do.
                    <br>
                    &lt;/<span style="color: #e06c75;">p</span>&gt;

                    <br>
                    One of my most significant contributions to the team was not part of any assignment: it was spending two hours in a group call with the team, one week before Part B was due, teaching them how to use git. At this stage, the team was stressed about the impending deadline, and we needed a way to quickly write and integrate a lot of interrelated code over a short period. Having learned git through other courses, I decided to create a repository on my GitHub page and teach the team how to clone it, pull updates, resolve merge conflicts, make commits and push their changes. However, I had severely underestimated the amount of issues we would encounter as I attempted to figure out how to use git with other operating systems and IDEs than my own. This resulted in the call taking an hour and a half longer than I told the group it would take, lasting long into the night, and leaving me feeling quite humiliated and guilty. However, these efforts paid off extremely well over the semester, especially for Part B, on which we - with the help of git - collaborated seamlessly on over the next 7 days, resulting in a 93% grade for the assignment. Though I believe I did help the team significantly with this contribution, I will surely make more effort in preparing for future tutorials I provide for my team members.
                    <br>
                    &lt;/<span style="color: #e06c75;">p</span>&gt;

                    <br>
                    My primary responsibility for Part B was creating a dummy version of the Dashboard page (figure-1), which was an implementation of a wireframe created by another team member (figure-2). As merely a HTML and CSS dummy page, this task required little more knowledge than that which I acquired through DECO1400, and I could thus complete it quickly and easily. As such, I decided to take the initiative to learn something new, and re-implemented the donut charts as an animated CSS widget, rather than a static image file, which I believe added a great degree of sophistication to the page.
                    <br>
                    &lt;/<span style="color: #e06c75;">p</span>&gt;
                </p>
            </section>
            <section class="file-contents" id="project-c-file-contents">
                <p>
                    &lt;<span style="color: #e06c75">p </span><span style="color: #e5c07b">id</span><span style="color: #98c379">="account-system-architecture"</span>&gt;
                    <br>
                    As the primary backend programmer in the team, most of the code I wrote for the website was for setting up the user account system using PHP in Part C. This user account system needed to store a range of data, including names, emails, passwords and user recycling data for display on the dashboard. I considered three approaches to accomplish this.
                    <br>
                    First, I could make use of the phpMyAdmin database provided to students, using SQL to log and retrieve user information. However, I found it difficult to find a way to interact with this database through code, and my proficiency with SQL is not well-developed. Therefore, I decided not to choose this option.
                    <br>
                    The second alternative I considered was utilising Google FireBase - a free product for backend handling, such as for storing user data, securely verifying login details, and much more. However, I found this software to be far more extensive than the purposes for which I intended to use it, and thus found it more difficult than necessary to integrate into the project. Furthermore, although I believed that, with some time, I could successfully integrate Google FireBase to have a very sophisticated and secure backend for the site, I felt that this was, in a sense, cheating, and that I would fail to demonstrate my backend programming abilities by letting FireBase do all the work. Therefore, I decided not to choose this option either.
                    <br>
                    Lastly, I considered a rather insecure - but relatively easy - way to manage the account system: writing user data in plain text to a JSON file. I chose this option because the issues of insecurity, I felt, were not relevant to this particular course (being a first year course, requiring minimal experience from students). Furthermore, I knew this method would be the easiest and fastest to implement, with a high degree of flexibility and manageability, as the database and its interactions require a minimal learning curve and minimal bloat.
                    <br>
                    &lt;/<span style="color: #e06c75;">p</span>&gt;
                    <br>
                    &lt;<span style="color: #e06c75">p </span><span style="color: #e5c07b">id</span><span style="color: #98c379">="account-system-implementation"</span>&gt;
                    <br>
                    Utilising PHP to implement the user account system was a long and difficult process, but was highly rewarding and valuable for my learning. It required the creation of six new files:
                    <br>
                    1. A JSON file, to store user data (figure-1).
                    <br>
                    2. A login page, to provide front-end access for reading from the account system.
                    <br>
                    3. An account verification file, to process input from the login page, verify these details, and store the account information as browser session values (figure-2).
                    <br>
                    4. A signup page, to provide front-end access for writing to the account system.
                    <br>
                    5. An account creator file, to process input from the signup page, store this information in the database and store the account information as browser session values.
                    <br>
                    6. A receipt-processing file, to verify receipt numbers provided to the frontend receipt-input page, and update the user recycling data accordingly.
                    <br>
                    I also converted the dashboard page, recycling page and CSS stylesheet to .php files, to integrate the user account system into the frontend of the website, and, for instance, display user-specific stats on the dashboard page, and greet users with their personal first name.
                    <br>
                    &lt;/<span style="color: #e06c75;">p</span>&gt;

                    <br>
                    It is telling from the responsibilities I adopted for the major project that I am much more comfortable with programming than designing. As such, I felt the best way to artistically represent myself in this portfolio was through a coding-themed design, with monospaced fonts, dark colours and metaphors such as file tabs and programming features like HTML tags. This design was fun to produce and I feel accurately demonstrates the kind of contributions I made to our team’s major project. I also believed this design granted me the opportunity to demonstrate my ability to use JavaScript to make a website interactive and engaging, such as through changing which images are displayed based on the “file” one selects.
                    <br>
                    &lt;/<span style="color: #e06c75;">p</span>&gt;
                    <br>
                    &lt;<span style="color: #e06c75">p </span><span style="color: #e5c07b">id</span><span style="color: #98c379">="implementing-the-code"</span>&gt;
                    <br>
                    Before writing any of the portfolio content, I decided to create all the design and functionality of the website first. After writing all the HTML (except for content paragraphs), CSS and JavaScript (figure-1), integrating the content was a seamless process, and I experienced little difficulty in creating any of these components.
                    <br>
                    &lt;/<span style="color: #e06c75;">p</span>&gt;
                    <br>
                    &lt;<span style="color: #e06c75">p </span><span style="color: #e5c07b">id</span><span style="color: #98c379">="thinking-deeper-about-code"</span>&gt;
                    <br>
                    If there is one thing I love about programming, its writing beautiful, clean code, and unlike in the major project, where your code must be integrated with others’ potentially-messy code, the portfolio project provided me with the opportunity to produce clean code which I took great pleasure in writing and perfecting. I understand however, that working in the software engineering industry will be far more like working on the major project than the portfolio. Indeed, cramming in a bodged and shaky user-account system last-minute, scrolling past hundreds of lines of spaghetti CSS code and navigating through indents upon indents of poorly structured HTML code is likely more profitable than spending hours refining a simple HTML page. In reflection, I am thus grateful to have projects such as these to work on throughout my time at university.

                    <br>
                    This course has been immensely valuable for my development as a software engineer, across many dimensions. Most notably, I have learned how to code in basic PHP, how the frontend of websites interact with backend servers and how to collaborate with others working on a web project. Moreover, I have honed my abilities to write frontend code with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, such that I believe I can create the frontend for any website I can think of. Having learned many techniques such as slicing webpages with PHP and storing browser session data, this course has given me a great degree of confidence in web development, and I am very proud of my achievements and contributions.
                    <br>
                    &lt;/<span style="color: #e06c75;">p</span>&gt;

                    <br>
                    Our team felt that, though the course as a whole was run quite well, errors in communication from course staff contributed to a more frustrating experience than necessary.
                    <br>
                    As one example, during our contact session the week before the Part A pitch was due, we were told that, since we had six group members, we would be given six minutes to give our presentation, since it was established earlier that each group member had to speak for the pitch. After preparing a six-minute presentation, we were then told during the next contact - just before our pitch was due - that we would only have five minutes to present. We therefore had to omit a significant portion of the pitch we had prepared, right before presenting it.
                    <br>
                    Another example is the confusion about the duration for the pitch and demo of the trade-show (figure-1).
                    <br>
                    &lt;/<span style="color: #e06c75;">p</span>&gt;
                    <br>
                    &lt;<span style="color: #e06c75">p </span><span style="color: #e5c07b">id</span><span style="color: #98c379">="recommendations-for-improvement"</span>&gt;
                    <br>
                    Overall, I believe the course could be greatly improved by merely simplifying it. The fact that many students were still confused by simple issues, even with huge explanations of assessments given on Blackboard, is testament to this. The trade-show, for instance, was fun and unique, but still left students asking questions such as “can I invite friends, or not?”, “when am I allowed to judge other teams’ presentations?”, “am I allowed to judge teams in my own contact sessions or not?”, “which Padlets do I use for leaving feedback to other teams?” and “am I allowed to leave now, or do we have to wait for two hours until the trade-show finishes?”. Although most - if not all - of these questions were likely covered on Blackboard and Discord, the amount of extra information required to be absorbed by students was too much for many, and left our team feeling as though too much of the assessments was merely learning details about how to submit the assessments, or, as one team member eloquently stated: “reading the swathes of fine print”. As a student, my primary recommendation is to simplify the course to reduce this fine print.
